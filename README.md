# Python Teaching 2023

The repository consist of two main folders: 

- notebooks: This is where exercise notebooks are stored. 
- utils_package: This is where the utility python package 'emo_utils' is stored. 

I think the simplest way is to git clone (with SSH) the repository to a local (but synced) Google Drives folder.
